Duplicate Question Pairs Detection

This project aims to identify whether two given questions are semantically similar, i.e., duplicates, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Duplicate question detection is a critical problem in many domains, particularly in platforms like Quora or Stack Overflow, where users often ask repetitive questions.
